# DSC540_Mid_Term_Project
you will be working on a mid-term project that takes you through a data cleansing project.  

You will select a dataset, perform various cleansing methods using Python to the dataset and submit your newly formatted readable dataset.The first step is selecting a dataset.  Your dataset must have a minimum of 1000 records and 15-20 variables.The authors of our book Data Wrangling with Python have some suggestions where datasets can be found on Pages 130-140 of your textbook. 

Some other helpful places to find datasets include:

https://community.tableau.com/docs/DOC-10635

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

http://www.data.gov

http://www.science.gov

http://data.gov.uk

http://gss.norc.org/

There are no restrictions on what dataset you use, other than you cannot use the specific datasets used in the book, and your dataset for the mid-term and final project must be different.You will turninyour mid-term at the end of Week 6.The following is due submitted to the assignment link or submit a link to your GitHub repository to the assignment link:

o Your dataset with the following transformations 

o Replace headers (Data Wrangling with Python pg. 154 –163)oFormat Data to a Readable Format (Data Wrangling with Python pg. 164 –168)

o Identify outliers and bad data (Data Wrangling with Python pg. 169 –174)

o Find Duplicates(Data Wrangling with Python pg. 175 –178)

o Conduct Fuzzy Matching(if you don’t have an obvious example to do this with in your data, create categories and use Fuzzy Matching to lump data together) (Data Wrangling with Python pg. 179 –188)
