# DSC 540 Mid Term Project



# Introduction
This repository displays the process of cleaning the dataset in the python environment. This project also had me preform other data wrangling methods to transform it into a readable dataset.



# Abstract
This was a  mid-term project that went more into data cleansing or data wrangling. I had to select a dataset, perform various cleansing methods using Python to the dataset and submitted my newly formatted readable dataset. My dataset had a minimum of 1000 records and 15-20 variables and this project was based on the Data Wrangling with Python book. Below were the guidelines of the project:

* Replace headers and Format Data to a Readable Format 
* Identify outliers and bad data 
* Find Duplicates
* Conduct Fuzzy Matching


# Summary of Skills
I used the python environment to preform a data cleaning process on a dataset. I also used a few python packages like Fuzzy matching to transform the dataset.

# Findings
I will remove the missing data by using the drop.na() function. I am removing a variable called SMULEV, it represent the counties and the dataset already has a variable called county. I am treating them as duplicates. The Age_Group variable needs to be replaced as a string. I will be looking for duplicate counties for this mid term project. I will be looking at the total age group variable and I will create a dataframe of this variable.



# Challenges
The challenging part of this project was getting the fuzzy matching to work correctly. The implementation was not the issue but, tunning it to match words that were in the dataset.



# Conclusion
After completing this project, I had more confidence in preforming data cleansing also known as data wrangling. At this star of this project, I wasn't sure how to go about doing this project. When I overcame the challenge of fuzzy matching, I saw the great power of this application.
